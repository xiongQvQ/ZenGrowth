# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Volcano (火山引擎) Doubao API integration as an alternative LLM provider to the existing user behavior analytics platform. The integration will provide users with the option to use Doubao models alongside or instead of Google Gemini for AI-powered analysis and insights generation. This enhancement supports multi-modal capabilities including text and image processing, expanding the platform's analytical capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to configure Volcano Doubao API as an LLM provider, so that I can use alternative AI models for analysis and reduce dependency on a single provider.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL read ARK_API_KEY from environment variables
2. WHEN ARK_API_KEY is configured THEN the system SHALL initialize Volcano OpenAI client with Beijing endpoint
3. WHEN Volcano client is initialized THEN it SHALL use the doubao-seed-1-6-250615 model as default
4. IF ARK_API_KEY is missing THEN the system SHALL log a warning and fall back to Google Gemini
5. WHEN configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL support hot-reloading of API settings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to choose between Google Gemini and Volcano Doubao for text analysis, so that I can compare results and select the best model for specific analysis tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing text analysis THEN the system SHALL provide LLM provider selection option
2. WHEN Volcano Doubao is selected THEN the system SHALL use OpenAI-compatible API calls
3. WHEN analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent response format regardless of provider
4. WHEN switching providers THEN the system SHALL preserve analysis context and parameters
5. WHEN provider fails THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with fallback provider

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to use multi-modal analysis capabilities with image and text inputs, so that I can analyze visual user behavior data alongside traditional metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN image data is provided THEN the system SHALL support image_url content type
2. WHEN multi-modal input is received THEN the system SHALL process both text and image content
3. WHEN image analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL return structured insights about visual content
4. WHEN combining text and image analysis THEN the system SHALL provide unified analytical results
5. WHEN image processing fails THEN the system SHALL continue with text-only analysis

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging for Volcano API integration, so that I can monitor system performance and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL log request details and response times
2. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with context
3. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle timeouts and connection errors
5. WHEN API quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL notify administrators and switch to fallback provider

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Volcano API integration to follow existing code patterns and architecture, so that the system remains maintainable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Volcano integration THEN it SHALL follow existing LLM provider patterns
2. WHEN adding new configuration THEN it SHALL use existing settings management system
3. WHEN creating new classes THEN they SHALL implement existing LLM interface contracts
4. WHEN writing tests THEN they SHALL follow existing test patterns and coverage standards
5. WHEN updating documentation THEN it SHALL include Volcano-specific configuration examples
