# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will containerize the User Behavior Analytics Platform using Docker to enable easy deployment across different environments. The containerization will include all necessary dependencies, configurations, and services required to run the platform in production or development environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to deploy the analytics platform using Docker containers, so that I can ensure consistent deployment across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `docker build` THEN the system SHALL create a Docker image containing all platform dependencies
2. WHEN a user runs `docker run` with the created image THEN the system SHALL start the Streamlit application accessible on the specified port
3. WHEN the container starts THEN the system SHALL automatically configure all required environment variables and dependencies
4. WHEN the application runs in the container THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality including GA4 data processing, agent orchestration, and visualization

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Docker Compose for local development, so that I can quickly set up the entire development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs `docker-compose up` THEN the system SHALL start all required services including the main application
2. WHEN using Docker Compose THEN the system SHALL mount local directories for development with hot-reload capabilities
3. WHEN the development environment starts THEN the system SHALL expose the application on a configurable port (default 8501)
4. WHEN environment variables are changed THEN the system SHALL allow easy configuration through docker-compose.yml or .env files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Docker image to be production-ready, so that I can deploy it in production environments with proper security and performance optimizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the production image THEN the system SHALL use multi-stage builds to minimize image size
2. WHEN the container runs THEN the system SHALL run as a non-root user for security
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL include proper health checks for container orchestration
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL support external volume mounts for data persistence and configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to easily configure the containerized application, so that I can customize settings without rebuilding the image.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the container THEN the system SHALL accept environment variables for all configurable parameters
2. WHEN configuration files are provided THEN the system SHALL support mounting external configuration files
3. WHEN API keys are required THEN the system SHALL securely handle sensitive environment variables
4. WHEN data directories are needed THEN the system SHALL support persistent volume mounts for data storage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a deployment engineer, I want comprehensive deployment documentation, so that I can successfully deploy and maintain the containerized platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing deployment options THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation for Docker run commands
2. WHEN using Docker Compose THEN the system SHALL include example configurations for different deployment scenarios
3. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide debugging guidelines and common issue resolutions
4. WHEN scaling THEN the system SHALL include guidance for container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the containerized application to maintain data integrity, so that analytics results remain accurate across different deployment methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing GA4 data in containers THEN the system SHALL produce identical results to non-containerized deployments
2. WHEN data is uploaded THEN the system SHALL properly handle file permissions and storage within the container
3. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL maintain proper file output capabilities
4. WHEN logs are created THEN the system SHALL provide accessible logging that can be collected by container orchestration systems
